# resume
my resume... in python
I've watched 2 1/2 hours of a python vid on YouTube so...
All I'm trying to do is give them the option to select 0 to 5 to find out more about me.
"0" finishes the program and provides my details with a thank you.
1-5 gives different areas of my resume.

Worked it out and I know it's sloppy but it works.
